We're no strangers to love<br>
You know the rules and so do I<br>
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
<br>
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
Gotta make you understand<br>
<br>
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
<br>
We've known each other for so long<br>
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it<br>
Inside we both know what's been going on<br>
We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
<br>
And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
<br>
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
<br>
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
<br>
(Ooh, give you up)<br>
(Ooh, give you up)<br>
(Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give (give you up)<br>
(Ooh) never gonna give, never gonna give (give you up)<br>
